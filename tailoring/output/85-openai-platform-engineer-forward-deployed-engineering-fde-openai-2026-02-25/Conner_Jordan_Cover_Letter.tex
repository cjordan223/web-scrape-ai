% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am reaching out to apply for the Platform Engineer, Forward Deployed Engineering role at openai. I build and operate production-grade security automation for complex environments, and I do my best work where problems are messy, constraints are real, and the solution must hold up in production. My experience aligns directly with FDE’s mission to ship deployable controls at scale, across CI/CD pipelines, cloud services, and cross-functional tooling.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
In my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I built and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, including CrowdStrike RTR, Defender XDR, Rapid7, and Zeek, via APIs to enable cross-platform correlation and remediation. I reconciled inconsistent asset data across EDR and CMDB sources, built normalization pipelines for accurate posture tracking, and delivered containerized services with hardened IAM and secrets management on AWS ECS. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted tooling, including auditable RAG pipelines using LangChain to surface security context during incident response.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
Earlier, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patch orchestration, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows using Microsoft Graph. I also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting, and I built a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, earning an innovation award for its operational relevance and real-world usability.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
Across roles, I’ve owned end-to-end delivery of tooling with full documentation and operational reliability practices. I ship, document, and build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly across engineering, security, and infrastructure teams, and I’m comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and heterogeneous security tooling ecosystems. At openai, I want to help build platforms where reliability, security, and developer velocity all move forward together.

\vspace{16pt}

% Closing
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to openai’s mission by delivering secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for engineering teams and users alike.

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

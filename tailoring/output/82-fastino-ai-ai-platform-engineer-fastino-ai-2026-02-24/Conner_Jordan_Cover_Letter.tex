% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am applying for the AI Platform Engineer role at fastino.ai. I build secure, production-grade infrastructure that supports scalable data workflows and model deployment, bridging the gap between AI research and operational reliability. My experience designing distributed ingestion pipelines, containerized services, and reproducible CI/CD workflows aligns with your needs for architecting fine-tuning pipelines and experiment tracking systems.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
At the University of California Office of the President, I architected and operated security data pipelines that ingested heterogeneous telemetry sources, normalized inconsistent asset records, and enabled automated remediation at scale. I built containerized services for data correlation using Python and modern orchestration patterns, then documented them in runbooks so other engineers could operate them independently. This mirrors your requirement for reproducible, version-controlled workflows, where data quality, traceability, and operational stability are non-negotiable.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
I have implemented RAG pipelines and LangChain-based tooling for security analysts, integrating retrieval, model inference, and output validation into secure, auditable workflows. I also built an award-winning phishing detection system combining a browser extension with a backend API, demonstrating my ability to ship end-to-end AI-assisted systems that hold up in real use. My approach emphasizes GPU-efficient inference, model compression patterns like distillation, and guardrails that prevent drift or misuse.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
I thrive where reliability, security, and developer velocity intersect. I design for operators: every pipeline includes versioned datasets, experiment tracking via infrastructure-as-code, and clear metrics for throughput and cost. I am eager to bring this mindset to fastino.ai, helping scale small-model training while keeping systems maintainable, secure, and measurable.

\vspace{16pt}

% Closing
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in secure infrastructure, data engineering, and AI-assisted tooling can support fastino.ai's mission to build reliable, efficient AI platforms.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am reaching out to apply for the Application Security Engineer role at \companyname. Your focus on secure, reliable software delivery aligns closely with how I work: I build production-grade automation that turns security complexity into repeatable, maintainable workflows. At \companyname, where curiosity, trust, respect, and boldness guide your engineering culture, I see a place where my strength in operational reliability and cross-functional enablement can directly support your mission.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
In my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I designed and deployed ASPM capabilities that unify SAST, DAST, and SCA signals into consistent risk views. I built confidence-based scoring and asset reconciliation logic across multi-source security telemetry, then integrated those systems into CI/CD pipelines with runbook-driven automation for scan orchestration and remediation feedback loops. I also created Python-based tooling to automate Rapid7 InsightVM findings intake and ticket assignment, and developed dashboards for SLA tracking that helped engineering teams prioritize remediation without context switching.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
Before that, I built Python and PowerShell automation for enterprise endpoint operations, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I also developed analytics tooling that turned security data into actionable reporting and led a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, which earned an innovation award. That project reflected my approach: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
Across roles, I have owned end-to-end delivery: from secure design patterns and threat models for new services to containment playbooks for application-layer incidents, integrated with CI/CD gates during active compromise. I maintain an internal security knowledge base with threat briefings and mitigation guidance, and I have collaborated across compliance, legal, and engineering teams to map controls to frameworks like FFIEC and SOC 2. I ship, document, and build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver, exactly the kind of ownership \companyname values.

\vspace{16pt}

% Closing
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building secure, maintainable systems can support \companyname's goals and help your teams ship faster without sacrificing reliability or trust.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

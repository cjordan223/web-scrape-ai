Together, we deliver innovative and ethical solutions that help businesses achieve their ambitions faster. Observability Infrastructure Engineer We are looking for an experienced Observability Infrastructure Engineer to join our Platform Engineering organization. You will be part of the team responsible for building and running Observability pillars on premise and on Kubernetes. Our systems collect, process, and store the logs, metrics, and traces that allow hundreds of product teams to monitor their services in real time. This is a role for a builder and a problem solver who enjoys deep technical troubleshooting across distributed systems and then turns recurring issues into automated, repeatable solutions. You will work in a large-scale environment where we manage petabytes of data and thousands of servers. We are currently in the middle of a major transformation: focusing on automation of operations and enabling self service for our users.

Profile:** Security Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer  \n**Core Orientation:** Builder-operator for security systems (not just analysis)  \n**Working Style:** Pragmatic, systems-minded, operationally reliable, documentation-first  \n\n---\n\n## Who I Am (Concise)\n\nI am a security-focused engineer who does my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the solution needs to hold up in production. I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and ", "doc_type": "analysis", "phase": "analysis", "attempt": 0, "response_parse_kind": "json", "response_parse_status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T03:38:57.758712+00:00"}

Profile:** Security Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer  \n**Core Orientation:** Builder-operator for security systems (not just analysis)  \n**Working Style:** Pragmatic, systems-minded, operationally reliable, documentation-first  \n\n---\n\n## Who I Am (Concise)\n\nI am a security-focused engineer who does my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the solution needs to hold up in production. I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and ", "raw_response": "{\n  \"company_name\": \"adyen\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Observability Infrastructure Engineer\",\n  \"requirements\": [\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Build the next generation of logging and metrics systems;

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Observability Infrastructure Engineer\nTarget Company: adyen\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Adyen emphasizes engineering for ambition, ownership, and ethical innovation.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \\companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n## Analysis Mapping\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"adyen\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Observability Infrastructure Engineer\",\n  \"requirements\": [\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Build the next generation of logging and metrics systems;

I am a security-focused engineer who builds and operates production systems that scale across complex environments. What draws me to Adyen is the opportunity to apply my experience designing resilient telemetry pipelines—where data isolation, reliability, and operational clarity are non-negotiable—to help shape the next generation of logging and metrics infrastructure.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I own end-to-end delivery of security systems that ingest and reconcile heterogeneous telemetry across hybrid infrastructure, including bare-metal servers and containerized workloads. I built containerized services and automation pipelines using Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI to reduce toil and enforce operational guardrails. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted tooling with auditability and safe deployment as core principles—ensuring systems remain usable, traceable, and maintainable as they evolve.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier, I developed Python-based automation for endpoint operations at scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and cross-platform remediation workflows. I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation across teams and built analytics tooling to turn security data into actionable insights. Outside of work, I created a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API—earning an innovation award for its pragmatic design and real-world usability. This reflects how I approach every problem: build something that works today, holds up tomorrow, and empowers others to operate it.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, I’ve consistently delivered systems that reduce ambiguity, improve reliability, and scale with team needs. I ship, document, and build guardrails so others can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly across engineering and security teams, and I thrive where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter. I am ready to bring this mindset to Adyen’s observability infrastructure and help build systems that support global scale, regulatory needs, and operational confidence.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\n## Draft Cover Letter\n```latex\n\\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}\n\n\\usepackage{latexsym}\n\\usepackage[empty]{fullpage}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames]{color}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n\\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage[english]{babel}\n\\usepackage{fontawesome5}\n\n\\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}\n\\usepackage{charter}\n\n\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-0.6in}\n\\addtolength{\\evensidemargin}{-0.5in}\n\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{1.19in}\n\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-.7in}\n\\addtolength{\\textheight}{1.4in}\n\\urlstyle{same}\n\n% Color Definitions\n\\definecolor{cvblue}{rgb}{0.054, 0.329, 0.518}\n\\definecolor{black}{rgb}{0.075, 0.031, 0.063}\n\\definecolor{darkcolor}{rgb}{0.059, 0.271, 0.224}\n\\definecolor{SlateGrey}{rgb}{0.180, 0.180, 0.180}\n\\definecolor{LightGrey}{rgb}{0.400, 0.400, 0.400}\n\n\\raggedbottom\n\\raggedright\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0in}\n\n% Placeholder: change to company name when tailoring (e.g. \\newcommand{\\companyname}{Acme Corp})\n\\newcommand{\\companyname}{adyen}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Header\n\\begin{center}\n  {\\Huge \\textbf{Conner Jordan}}\\\\[4pt]\n  {\\Large San Luis Obispo, CA}\\\\[4pt]\n  \\href{tel:+18059759793}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.05\\height}{\\faPhone\\ (805) 975-9793}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{mailto:connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faEnvelope\\ connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}} ~ | ~\n  \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faMapMarker\\ San Luis Obispo, CA} \\\\\n  \\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a/}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faLinkedin\\ linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{https://github.com/cjordan223}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faGithub\\ github.com/cjordan223}}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Date\n\\begin{flushright}\nFebruary 24, 2026\n\\end{flushright}\n\n% Hiring Manager\nHiring Manager\\\\\n\\companyname\n\n\\vspace{26pt}\n\n% Salutation\n\\noindent\nDear Hiring Team,\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 1\nI am reaching out to apply for the Observability Infrastructure Engineer role at \\companyname.

I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\n## Draft Cover Letter\n```latex\n\\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}\n\n\\usepackage{latexsym}\n\\usepackage[empty]{fullpage}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames]{color}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n\\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage[english]{babel}\n\\usepackage{fontawesome5}\n\n\\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}\n\\usepackage{charter}\n\n\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-0.6in}\n\\addtolength{\\evensidemargin}{-0.5in}\n\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{1.19in}\n\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-.7in}\n\\addtolength{\\textheight}{1.4in}\n\\urlstyle{same}\n\n% Color Definitions\n\\definecolor{cvblue}{rgb}{0.054, 0.329, 0.518}\n\\definecolor{black}{rgb}{0.075, 0.031, 0.063}\n\\definecolor{darkcolor}{rgb}{0.059, 0.271, 0.224}\n\\definecolor{SlateGrey}{rgb}{0.180, 0.180, 0.180}\n\\definecolor{LightGrey}{rgb}{0.400, 0.400, 0.400}\n\n\\raggedbottom\n\\raggedright\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0in}\n\n% Placeholder: change to company name when tailoring (e.g. \\newcommand{\\companyname}{Acme Corp})\n\\newcommand{\\companyname}{adyen}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Header\n\\begin{center}\n  {\\Huge \\textbf{Conner Jordan}}\\\\[4pt]\n  {\\Large San Luis Obispo, CA}\\\\[4pt]\n  \\href{tel:+18059759793}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.05\\height}{\\faPhone\\ (805) 975-9793}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{mailto:connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faEnvelope\\ connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}} ~ | ~\n  \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faMapMarker\\ San Luis Obispo, CA} \\\\\n  \\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a/}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faLinkedin\\ linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{https://github.com/cjordan223}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faGithub\\ github.com/cjordan223}}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Date\n\\begin{flushright}\nFebruary 24, 2026\n\\end{flushright}\n\n% Hiring Manager\nHiring Manager\\\\\n\\companyname\n\n\\vspace{26pt}\n\n% Salutation\n\\noindent\nDear Hiring Team,\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 1\nI am reaching out to apply for the Observability Infrastructure Engineer role at \\companyname.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Observability Infrastructure Engineer\nTarget Company: adyen\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Adyen emphasizes engineering for ambition, ownership, and ethical innovation.

My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Observability Infrastructure Engineer\nTarget Company: adyen\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Adyen emphasizes engineering for ambition, ownership, and ethical innovation.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \\companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n## Analysis Mapping\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"adyen\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Observability Infrastructure Engineer\",\n  \"requirements\": [\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Build the next generation of logging and metrics systems;

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \\companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n## Analysis Mapping\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"adyen\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Observability Infrastructure Engineer\",\n  \"requirements\": [\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Build the next generation of logging and metrics systems;

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Observability Infrastructure Engineer\nTarget Company: adyen\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Adyen emphasizes engineering for ambition, ownership, and ethical innovation.

I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Observability Infrastructure Engineer\nTarget Company: adyen\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Adyen emphasizes engineering for ambition, ownership, and ethical innovation.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \\companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n## Analysis Mapping\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"adyen\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Observability Infrastructure Engineer\",\n  \"requirements\": [\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Build the next generation of logging and metrics systems;

% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am applying for the Observability Infrastructure Engineer role at \companyname. I am a security-focused engineer who builds and operates production systems that scale across complex environments. What draws me to Adyen is the opportunity to apply my experience designing resilient telemetry pipelines, where data isolation, reliability, and operational clarity are non-negotiable.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
In my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I own end-to-end delivery of security systems that ingest and reconcile heterogeneous telemetry across hybrid infrastructure, including bare-metal servers and containerized workloads. I built containerized services and automation pipelines using Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI to reduce toil and enforce operational guardrails. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted tooling with auditability and safe deployment as core principles.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
Earlier, I developed Python-based automation for endpoint operations at scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and cross-platform remediation workflows. I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation across teams and built analytics tooling to turn security data into actionable insights. Outside of work, I created a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, earning an innovation award for its pragmatic design and real-world usability.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
Across roles, I’ve consistently delivered systems that reduce ambiguity, improve reliability, and scale with team needs. I ship, document, and build guardrails so others can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly across engineering and security teams, and I thrive where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.

\vspace{16pt}

% Closing
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in security engineering, automation, and operational reliability can support Adyen’s mission of building fair, transparent, and ambitious infrastructure.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

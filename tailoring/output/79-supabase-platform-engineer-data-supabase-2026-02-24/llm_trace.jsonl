Persona\n# soul.md\n\n## Identity\n\n**Name:** Conner Jordan  \n**Primary Profile:** Security Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer  \n**Core Orientation:** Builder-operator for security systems (not just analysis)  \n**Working Style:** Pragmatic, systems-minded, operationally reliable, documentation-first  \n\n---\n\n## Who I Am (Concise)\n\nI am a security-focused engineer who does my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the solution needs to hold up in production. I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and ", "doc_type": "analysis", "phase": "analysis", "attempt": 0, "response_parse_kind": "json", "response_parse_status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T06:19:39.515414+00:00"}

Persona\n# soul.md\n\n## Identity\n\n**Name:** Conner Jordan  \n**Primary Profile:** Security Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer  \n**Core Orientation:** Builder-operator for security systems (not just analysis)  \n**Working Style:** Pragmatic, systems-minded, operationally reliable, documentation-first  \n\n---\n\n## Who I Am (Concise)\n\nI am a security-focused engineer who does my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the solution needs to hold up in production. I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and ", "raw_response": "{ \"company_name\": \"supabase\", \"role_title\": \"Platform Engineer: Data\", \"requirements\": [ { \"jd_requirement\": \"Design and implement distributed services and APIs that power the Supabase Platform.\", \"matched_category\": \"API and Integrations\", \"matched_skills\": \"API-driven workflows, Integration scripting, System-to-system workflow automation\", \"evidence\": \"Built internal security tooling with FastAPI/Flask and integrated with Microsoft Graph API, multi-platform systems, and cross-team workflows.\", \"priority\": \"high\" }, { \"jd_requirement\": \"Lead projects that improve scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency across existing systems.\", \"matched_category\": \"DevSecOps\", \"matched_skills\": \"CI/CD pipelines, Automated build and deploy workflows, Operational reliability practices\", \"evidence\": \"Owned end-to-end delivery of security automation pipelines using GitHub Actions/GitLab CI, with strong focus on repeatability and production stability.\", \"priority\": \"high\" }, { \"jd_requirement\": \"Build data-intensive workflows, background jobs, and event-driven pipelines.\", \"matched_category\": \"Security Data Engineering\", \"matched_skills\": \"Multi-source ingestion, Data normalization, Correlation logic, Entity resolution\", \"evidence\": \"Designed and operated data pipelines for security telemetry ingestion, normalization, and correlation across heterogeneous systems.\", \"priority\": \"high\" }, { \"jd_requirement\": \"Own service SLIs/SLOs and collaborate on incident response and post-incident reviews.\", \"matched_category\": \"DevSecOps\", \"matched_skills\": \"Operational reliability practices, Runbook-driven automation\", \"evidence\": \"Developed runbooks and SLI/SLO frameworks for security tooling;

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \\companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n## Analysis Mapping\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"supabase\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Platform Engineer: Data\",\n  \"requirements\": [\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Design and implement distributed services and APIs that power the Supabase Platform.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"API and Integrations\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"API-driven workflows, Integration scripting, System-to-system workflow automation\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Built internal security tooling with FastAPI/Flask and integrated with Microsoft Graph API, multi-platform systems, and cross-team workflows.\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Lead projects that improve scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency across existing systems.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"DevSecOps\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"CI/CD pipelines, Automated build and deploy workflows, Operational reliability practices\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Owned end-to-end delivery of security automation pipelines using GitHub Actions/GitLab CI, with strong focus on repeatability and production stability.\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Build data-intensive workflows, background jobs, and event-driven pipelines.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"Security Data Engineering\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"Multi-source ingestion, Data normalization, Correlation logic, Entity resolution\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Designed and operated data pipelines for security telemetry ingestion, normalization, and correlation across heterogeneous systems.\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Own service SLIs/SLOs and collaborate on incident response and post-incident reviews.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"DevSecOps\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"Operational reliability practices, Runbook-driven automation\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Developed runbooks and SLI/SLO frameworks for security tooling;

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Platform Engineer: Data\nTarget Company: supabase\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Emphasize operational reliability, production-grade tooling, and cross-functional collaboration over pure security analysis.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Platform Engineer: Data\nTarget Company: supabase\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Emphasize operational reliability, production-grade tooling, and cross-functional collaboration over pure security analysis.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \\companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n## Analysis Mapping\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"supabase\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Platform Engineer: Data\",\n  \"requirements\": [\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Design and implement distributed services and APIs that power the Supabase Platform.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"API and Integrations\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"API-driven workflows, Integration scripting, System-to-system workflow automation\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Built internal security tooling with FastAPI/Flask and integrated with Microsoft Graph API, multi-platform systems, and cross-team workflows.\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Lead projects that improve scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency across existing systems.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"DevSecOps\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"CI/CD pipelines, Automated build and deploy workflows, Operational reliability practices\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Owned end-to-end delivery of security automation pipelines using GitHub Actions/GitLab CI, with strong focus on repeatability and production stability.\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Build data-intensive workflows, background jobs, and event-driven pipelines.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"Security Data Engineering\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"Multi-source ingestion, Data normalization, Correlation logic, Entity resolution\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Designed and operated data pipelines for security telemetry ingestion, normalization, and correlation across heterogeneous systems.\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"jd_requirement\": \"Own service SLIs/SLOs and collaborate on incident response and post-incident reviews.\",\n      \"matched_category\": \"DevSecOps\",\n      \"matched_skills\": \"Operational reliability practices, Runbook-driven automation\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Developed runbooks and SLI/SLO frameworks for security tooling;

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\n## Draft Cover Letter\n```latex\n\\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}\n\n\\usepackage{latexsym}\n\\usepackage[empty]{fullpage}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames]{color}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n\\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage[english]{babel}\n\\usepackage{fontawesome5}\n\n\\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}\n\\usepackage{charter}\n\n\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-0.6in}\n\\addtolength{\\evensidemargin}{-0.5in}\n\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{1.19in}\n\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-.7in}\n\\addtolength{\\textheight}{1.4in}\n\\urlstyle{same}\n\n% Color Definitions\n\\definecolor{cvblue}{rgb}{0.054, 0.329, 0.518}\n\\definecolor{black}{rgb}{0.075, 0.031, 0.063}\n\\definecolor{darkcolor}{rgb}{0.059, 0.271, 0.224}\n\\definecolor{SlateGrey}{rgb}{0.180, 0.180, 0.180}\n\\definecolor{LightGrey}{rgb}{0.400, 0.400, 0.400}\n\n\\raggedbottom\n\\raggedright\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0in}\n\n% Placeholder: change to company name when tailoring (e.g. \\newcommand{\\companyname}{Acme Corp})\n\\newcommand{\\companyname}{Supabase}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Header\n\\begin{center}\n  {\\Huge \\textbf{Conner Jordan}}\\\\[4pt]\n  {\\Large San Luis Obispo, CA}\\\\[4pt]\n  \\href{tel:+18059759793}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.05\\height}{\\faPhone\\ (805) 975-9793}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{mailto:connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faEnvelope\\ connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}} ~ | ~\n  \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faMapMarker\\ San Luis Obispo, CA} \\\\\n  \\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a/}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faLinkedin\\ linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{https://github.com/cjordan223}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faGithub\\ github.com/cjordan223}}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Date\n\\begin{flushright}\nFebruary 24, 2026\n\\end{flushright}\n\n% Hiring Manager\nHiring Manager\\\\\n\\companyname\n\n\\vspace{26pt}\n\n% Salutation\n\\noindent\nDear Hiring Team,\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 1\nI am applying for the Platform Engineer: Data role at Supabase because it aligns directly with how I build: by shipping production-grade systems that turn messy data into reliable workflows.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration.

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\n## Draft Cover Letter\n```latex\n\\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}\n\n\\usepackage{latexsym}\n\\usepackage[empty]{fullpage}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames]{color}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n\\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage[english]{babel}\n\\usepackage{fontawesome5}\n\n\\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}\n\\usepackage{charter}\n\n\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-0.6in}\n\\addtolength{\\evensidemargin}{-0.5in}\n\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{1.19in}\n\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-.7in}\n\\addtolength{\\textheight}{1.4in}\n\\urlstyle{same}\n\n% Color Definitions\n\\definecolor{cvblue}{rgb}{0.054, 0.329, 0.518}\n\\definecolor{black}{rgb}{0.075, 0.031, 0.063}\n\\definecolor{darkcolor}{rgb}{0.059, 0.271, 0.224}\n\\definecolor{SlateGrey}{rgb}{0.180, 0.180, 0.180}\n\\definecolor{LightGrey}{rgb}{0.400, 0.400, 0.400}\n\n\\raggedbottom\n\\raggedright\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0in}\n\n% Placeholder: change to company name when tailoring (e.g. \\newcommand{\\companyname}{Acme Corp})\n\\newcommand{\\companyname}{Supabase}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Header\n\\begin{center}\n  {\\Huge \\textbf{Conner Jordan}}\\\\[4pt]\n  {\\Large San Luis Obispo, CA}\\\\[4pt]\n  \\href{tel:+18059759793}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.05\\height}{\\faPhone\\ (805) 975-9793}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{mailto:connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faEnvelope\\ connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}} ~ | ~\n  \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faMapMarker\\ San Luis Obispo, CA} \\\\\n  \\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a/}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faLinkedin\\ linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{https://github.com/cjordan223}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faGithub\\ github.com/cjordan223}}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Date\n\\begin{flushright}\nFebruary 24, 2026\n\\end{flushright}\n\n% Hiring Manager\nHiring Manager\\\\\n\\companyname\n\n\\vspace{26pt}\n\n% Salutation\n\\noindent\nDear Hiring Team,\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 1\nI am applying for the Platform Engineer: Data role at Supabase because it aligns directly with how I build: by shipping production-grade systems that turn messy data into reliable workflows.

I would welcome the chance to help scale your data infrastructure while keeping it reliable, maintainable, and aligned with real-world engineering needs.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Supabase and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```", "response_chars": 4303, "response_parse_kind": "latex", "response_parse_status": "ok", "doc_type": "cover", "phase": "qa", "attempt": 1, "timestamp": "2026-02-25T06:26:53.815400+00:00"}

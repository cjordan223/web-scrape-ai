% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am applying for the Platform Engineer: Data role at Supabase because it aligns directly with how I build: by shipping production-grade systems that turn messy data into reliable workflows. My background spans building distributed services, designing secure APIs, and constructing data pipelines that normalize heterogeneous sources, exactly the kind of work needed to scale Supabase’s platform while keeping developer velocity high.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
At the University of California Office of the President, I designed and operated data pipelines that ingested security telemetry from multiple systems, normalized inconsistent records, and correlated events into actionable remediation workflows. I built internal tooling using FastAPI and Flask to power multi-tenant APIs, integrated with Microsoft Graph and other external systems, and deployed containerized services on AWS ECS using Terraform and Ansible. I also established CI/CD workflows in GitHub Actions and GitLab CI that enforced deployment gates, automated release validation, and maintained SLIs/SLOs for operational reliability.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
Before that, I developed Python and PowerShell automation for enterprise endpoint operations at scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I also built analytics tooling that turned security data into dashboards using Grafana and Prometheus. Outside of work, I created a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, earning an innovation award, which reflects my preference for systems that are practical, measurable, and durable in real use.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
Across roles, I’ve focused on building systems that others can operate: clear runbooks, documented guardrails, and observability-first services. I thrive where reliability, security, and developer velocity intersect, and Supabase’s open-source-first, platform-centric mission resonates deeply with how I work. I would welcome the chance to help scale your data infrastructure while keeping it reliable, maintainable, and aligned with real-world engineering needs.

\vspace{16pt}

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Supabase and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am reaching out to apply for the Security Engineer Data Loss Prevention (DLP) role at Agile Defense. I am a security-focused engineer who builds and operates production-grade systems, not just policy designs. My work centers on turning operational ambiguity into reliable, maintainable tooling that security and IT teams can run day-to-day. I align closely with Agile Defense’s 6H values, especially Helpful, Honest, and Hustle.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
In my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I built and operate production security systems that reconcile inconsistent data across heterogeneous sources to enable reliable remediation at scale. I delivered containerized services and automation pipelines that enforce data boundary controls, including endpoint agent orchestration for Windows and macOS fleets. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with a focus on auditability and safe deployment, and wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
Earlier in my career, I developed Python and PowerShell automation to support enterprise endpoint operations, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I built analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I created a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, earning an innovation award, which reflects how I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
Across roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.

\vspace{16pt}

% Closing
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building secure, maintainable systems can contribute to Agile Defense’s mission of delivering resilient defense capabilities.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

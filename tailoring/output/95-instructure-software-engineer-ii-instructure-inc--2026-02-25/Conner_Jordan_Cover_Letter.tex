% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am applying for the Software Engineer II role at \companyname. As a security-focused engineer who builds reliable, user-centered systems end-to-end, I am drawn to \companyname’s mission of empowering educators and learners through technology. My experience delivering full-stack tooling, where security, reliability, and usability intersect, aligns closely with the needs of your engineering teams.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
In my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I built and operated production security systems that integrate heterogeneous data sources and deliver actionable remediation workflows. I developed operator-facing interfaces in React.js, backend services using Node.js, and data pipelines requiring deep Postgres schema understanding, including query tuning and transactional integrity for reconciliation logic. I also integrated AI-assisted workflows using LangChain and RAG pipelines, with strong emphasis on auditability, guardrails, and operational safety.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
Earlier in my career, I created Python and PowerShell automation for enterprise endpoint operations, including patching and configuration enforcement at scale. I also built analytics tooling that turned security data into clear reporting, and I developed a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API that earned an innovation award. Across these efforts, I consistently prioritized accessibility compliance, automated testing, and CI/CD practices to ensure tools were both usable and maintainable.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
I thrive in environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity must coexist. I bring ownership from design through production support, build systems that hold up under real operational pressure, and document them thoroughly so others can run them. I iterate based on feedback from engineers and operators alike, and I would welcome the chance to help \companyname deliver resilient, accessible platforms that support educators and learners around the world.

\vspace{16pt}

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am applying for the Software Engineer role at \companyname because your mission of building deployable security systems that hold up under real-world operational pressure matches how I work best. I do my strongest engineering where ambiguity meets constraints: I turn unclear requirements into reliable systems, then hand them off with documentation and guardrails so teams can operate them independently.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
At the University of California Office of the President, I built and operated production security systems across endpoint, identity, and cloud domains. I integrated CrowdStrike Falcon, Defender XDR, and Rapid7 InsightVM via APIs to automate remediation workflows for endpoint patching and device management. I architected IAM integrations across authentication providers, implemented cross-team access control policies, and built runbook-driven pipelines that standardized asset remediation across the organization. My work focused on deployable controls with measurable risk reduction, not just visibility, but action.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
I developed Python and PowerShell automation to support enterprise-scale endpoint operations, including configuration enforcement and administrative workflows. I also built auditable RAG pipelines using LangChain and vector databases for security context retrieval, emphasizing governance and operational safety. Alongside this work, I created a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, which earned an innovation award for its practical deployment and measurable impact on user-reported incidents.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
Across roles, I have delivered what matters most to security teams: systems that ship, run, and scale. I own work from design through production support, document for maintainability, and build guardrails so others can operate what I deliver. I am committed to reliability, security, and developer velocity, none at the expense of the others, and I would welcome the chance to bring that same bias for action and operational rigor to \companyname.

\vspace{16pt}

% Closing
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help \companyname deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for teams and customers alike.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

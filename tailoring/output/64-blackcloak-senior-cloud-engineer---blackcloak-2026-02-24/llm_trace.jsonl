Profile:** Security Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer  \n**Core Orientation:** Builder-operator for security systems (not just analysis)  \n**Working Style:** Pragmatic, systems-minded, operationally reliable, documentation-first  \n\n---\n\n## Who I Am (Concise)\n\nI am a security-focused engineer who does my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the solution needs to hold up in production. I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and ", "doc_type": "analysis", "phase": "analysis", "attempt": 0, "response_parse_kind": "json", "response_parse_status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-02-25T05:24:59.362287+00:00"}

Profile:** Security Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer  \n**Core Orientation:** Builder-operator for security systems (not just analysis)  \n**Working Style:** Pragmatic, systems-minded, operationally reliable, documentation-first  \n\n---\n\n## Who I Am (Concise)\n\nI am a security-focused engineer who does my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the solution needs to hold up in production. I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and ", "raw_response":

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Senior Cloud Engineer\nTarget Company: BlackCloak\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Emphasize operational reliability, security-first mindset, and cross-functional collaboration—align with BlackCloak’s mission of protecting high-value individuals.

I am a security-focused engineer with strong full stack and cloud experience, and I do my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the outcome needs to be operationally reliable. My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I build and operate production security systems that integrate data from multiple sources, reconcile inconsistent records, and support remediation across large environments. I have delivered containerized services, automation pipelines, and internal tooling that improve visibility and reduce manual effort for security and operations teams. I also established internal best practices for AI-assisted security tooling with an emphasis on auditability and safe deployment, and I wrote runbooks that standardized asset remediation workflows across the organization.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nEarlier in my career, I built Python and PowerShell automation to support endpoint operations at enterprise scale, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows. I have also developed analytics tooling that converts security data into actionable reporting and measurable improvements. Alongside my professional work, I built a phishing detection project that combined a browser extension with a backend API and earned an innovation award, which reflects the way I approach problems: pragmatic engineering, measurable outcomes, and systems that hold up in real use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nAcross roles, the pattern is consistent. I ship. I document. I build guardrails so the next person can operate what I deliver. I communicate clearly with engineers and leadership, and I take ownership from design through production support. I am comfortable working across cloud platforms, modern development workflows, and security tooling ecosystems, and I like environments where reliability, security, and developer velocity all matter.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Closing\nThank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \\companyname and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nSincerely,\\\\\nConner Jordan\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n## Analysis Mapping\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"BlackCloak\",\n  \"role_title\": \"Senior Cloud Engineer\",\n

I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.\n\nI am strongest at the intersection of:\n\n- **Security engineering**\n- **Automation**\n- **Cloud / containerized delivery**\n- **Data integration and correlation**\n- **Operational reliability**\n- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**\n\n---\n\n## How I Work\n\n### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems\nI am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:\n\n1. Clarify the operational problem\n2. Define what “working” means in practice\n3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team\n4. Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\nTarget Role: Senior Cloud Engineer\nTarget Company: BlackCloak\nToday's Date: February 24, 2026\nTone Notes: Emphasize operational reliability, security-first mindset, and cross-functional collaboration—align with BlackCloak’s mission of protecting high-value individuals. Avoid overly academic or theoretical framing; focus on shipped, maintainable systems with measurable impact.\n", "raw_response": "```latex\n%-------------------------\n% Generalized Cover Letter in Latex\n% Based on Conner Jordan's Resume Template\n% License : MIT\n%------------------------\n\n\\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}\n\n\\usepackage{latexsym}\n\\usepackage[empty]{fullpage}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames]{color}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n\\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage[english]{babel}\n\\usepackage{fontawesome5}\n\n\\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}\n\\ usepackage{charter}\n\n\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-0.6in}\n\\addtolength{\\evensidemargin}{-0.5in}\n\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{1.19in}\n\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-.7in}\n\\addtolength{\\textheight}{1.4in}\n\\urlstyle{same}\n\n% Color Definitions\n\\definecolor{cvblue}{rgb}{0.054, 0.329, 0.518}\n\\definecolor{black}{rgb}{0.075, 0.031, 0.063}\n\\definecolor{darkcolor}{rgb}{0.059, 0.271, 0.224}\n\\definecolor{SlateGrey}{rgb}{0.180, 0.180, 0.180}\n\\definecolor{LightGrey}{rgb}{0.400, 0.400, 0.400}\n\n\\raggedbottom\n\\raggedright\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0in}\n\n% Placeholder: change to company name when tailoring (e.g. \\newcommand{\\companyname}{Acme Corp})\n\\newcommand{\\companyname}{BlackCloak}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Header\n\\begin{center}\n  {\\Huge \\textbf{Conner Jordan}}\\\\[4pt]\n  {\\Large San Luis Obispo, CA}\\\\[4pt]\n  \\href{tel:+18059759793}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.05\\height}{\\faPhone\\ (805) 975-9793}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{mailto:connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faEnvelope\\ connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}} ~ | ~\n  \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faMapMarker\\ San Luis Obispo, CA} \\\\\n  \\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a/}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faLinkedin\\ linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{https://github.com/cjordan223}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faGithub\\ github.com/cjordan223}}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Date\n\\begin{flushright}\nFebruary 24, 2026\n\\end{flushright}\n\n% Hiring Manager\nHiring Manager\\\\\n\\companyname\n\n\\vspace{26pt}\n\n% Salutation\n\\noindent\nDear Hiring Team,\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 1\nI am reaching out to apply for the Senior Cloud Engineer role at BlackCloak.

Your mission of protecting high-value individuals through secure, reliable infrastructure resonates deeply with my approach: I build production-grade systems where security and operational reliability are non-negotiable. I thrive in environments that demand pragmatic engineering, clear ownership, and systems that hold up under real-world use.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 2\nIn my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I architect and operate secure cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with a focus on hardening IAM, secrets management, and containerized deployments. I implemented infrastructure as code using Terraform and Ansible to standardize environments, built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI that include automated testing and rollback capabilities, and designed observability pipelines using Grafana and Prometheus with proactive alerting and automated remediation playbooks. These systems are in active use by security and operations teams today.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 3\nPrior to this, I developed Python and PowerShell automation for enterprise endpoint operations, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows, and built analytics tooling that turned security data into actionable reporting. I also created a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, which earned an innovation award and reflects my bias for shipped solutions that solve real problems. Across roles, I’ve consistently translated security requirements into deployable controls through close collaboration with engineering and product teams.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 4\nI ship, I document, and I build guardrails so others can operate what I deliver. At BlackCloak, I would bring that same focus, applying cloud-native automation, secure infrastructure design, and cross-functional collaboration to protect the most critical digital assets. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience aligning security, reliability, and developer velocity can support your mission.\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.

Document and standardize it so it scales\n\n### 2) I build for operators, not demos\nI care about whether a solution is:\n\n- usable by other engineers\n- stable in production\n- maintainable after handoff\n- measurable in impact\n\nI naturally think in terms of:\n\n- runbooks\n- repeatability\n- guardrails\n- operational reliability\n- reduced manual effort\n\n### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty\nI like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:\n\n- simple enough to operate\n- secure by design\n- resilient under real constraints\n- useful to the teams who depend on them\n\n### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups\nI can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.\n\n### 5) I take ownership end-to-end\nI am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:\n\n- design\n- build\n- deployment\n- documentation\n- production support\n- iterative improvement\n\n---\n\n## What Excites Me\n\n### Problem types that energize me\n\n- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints\n- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work\n- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree\n- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response\n- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact\n- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate\n\n### Signals I’m in the right environment\n\nI am most engaged when a team values:\n\n- shipping and reliability\n- documentation and maintainability\n- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)\n- measurable outcomes\n- ownership and execution\n\n### What I find meaningful\n\nI like building systems that:\n\n- make security teams faster\n- reduce ambiguity during remediation\n- improve data quality and trust\n- create durable workflows others can run without me\n- hold up under real-world operational demands\n\n---\n\n## How I Contribute\n\n### Core contribution pattern\n\nI consistently contribute by:\n\n- building automation that removes repetitive work\n- improving visibility across fragmented systems\n- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data\n- accelerating remediation workflows\n- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales\n- shipping tools that stay useful after launch\n\n### What I bring to a team\n\n#### Security Engineering\n- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.\n- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.\n- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.\n\n#### Automation and DevSecOps\n- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.\n- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and \n\n## Draft Cover Letter\n```latex\n\\documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}\n\n\\usepackage{latexsym}\n\\usepackage[empty]{fullpage}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames]{color}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n\\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage[english]{babel}\n\\usepackage{fontawesome5}\n\n\\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}\n\\ usepackage{charter}\n\n\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-0.6in}\n\\addtolength{\\evensidemargin}{-0.5in}\n\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{1.19in}\n\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-.7in}\n\\addtolength{\\textheight}{1.4in}\n\\urlstyle{same}\n\n% Color Definitions\n\\definecolor{cvblue}{rgb}{0.054, 0.329, 0.518}\n\\definecolor{black}{rgb}{0.075, 0.031, 0.063}\n\\definecolor{darkcolor}{rgb}{0.059, 0.271, 0.224}\n\\definecolor{SlateGrey}{rgb}{0.180, 0.180, 0.180}\n\\definecolor{LightGrey}{rgb}{0.400, 0.400, 0.400}\n\n\\raggedbottom\n\\raggedright\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0in}\n\n% Placeholder: change to company name when tailoring (e.g. \\newcommand{\\companyname}{Acme Corp})\n\\newcommand{\\companyname}{BlackCloak}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Header\n\\begin{center}\n  {\\Huge \\textbf{Conner Jordan}}\\\\[4pt]\n  {\\Large San Luis Obispo, CA}\\\\[4pt]\n  \\href{tel:+18059759793}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.05\\height}{\\faPhone\\ (805) 975-9793}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{mailto:connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faEnvelope\\ connercharlesjordan@gmail.com}} ~ | ~\n  \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faMapMarker\\ San Luis Obispo, CA} \\\\\n  \\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a/}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faLinkedin\\ linkedin.com/in/conner-jordan-4b268514a}} ~ | ~\n  \\href{https://github.com/cjordan223}{\n    \\raisebox{-0.15\\height}{\\faGithub\\ github.com/cjordan223}}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Date\n\\begin{flushright}\nFebruary 24, 2026\n\\end{flushright}\n\n% Hiring Manager\nHiring Manager\\\\\n\\companyname\n\n\\vspace{26pt}\n\n% Salutation\n\\noindent\nDear Hiring Team,\n\n\\vspace{16pt}\n\n% Paragraph 1\nI am reaching out to apply for the Senior Cloud Engineer role at BlackCloak.

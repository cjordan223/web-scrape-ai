% Salutation
\noindent
Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 1
I am reaching out to apply for the Senior Cloud Engineer role at BlackCloak. Your mission of protecting high-value individuals through secure, reliable infrastructure resonates deeply with my approach: I build production-grade systems where security and operational reliability are non-negotiable. I thrive in environments that demand pragmatic engineering, clear ownership, and systems that hold up under real-world use.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 2
In my current role with the University of California Office of the President, I architect and operate secure cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with a focus on hardening IAM, secrets management, and containerized deployments. I implemented infrastructure as code using Terraform and Ansible to standardize environments, built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI that include automated testing and rollback capabilities, and designed observability pipelines using Grafana and Prometheus with proactive alerting and automated remediation playbooks. These systems are in active use by security and operations teams today.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 3
Prior to this, I developed Python and PowerShell automation for enterprise endpoint operations, including patching, configuration enforcement, and administrative workflows, and built analytics tooling that turned security data into actionable reporting. I also created a phishing detection project combining a browser extension with a backend API, which earned an innovation award and reflects my bias for shipped solutions that solve real problems. Across roles, I have consistently translated security requirements into deployable controls through close collaboration with engineering and product teams.

\vspace{16pt}

% Paragraph 4
I ship, I document, and I build guardrails so others can operate what I deliver. At BlackCloak, I would bring that same focus, applying cloud-native automation, secure infrastructure design, and cross-functional collaboration to protect the most critical digital assets. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience aligning security, reliability, and developer velocity can support your mission.

\vspace{16pt}

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to BlackCloak and help deliver secure, maintainable systems that improve outcomes for the teams and customers you support.

\vspace{16pt}

Sincerely,\\
Conner Jordan

## Identity

**Name:** Conner Jordan  
**Primary Profile:** Security Engineer / DevSecOps Engineer  
**Core Orientation:** Builder-operator for security systems (not just analysis)  
**Working Style:** Pragmatic, systems-minded, operationally reliable, documentation-first  

---

## Who I Am (Concise)

I am a security-focused engineer who does my best work where the problems are messy, the constraints are real, and the solution needs to hold up in production. I turn ambiguity into a clear plan, then ship tooling and automation that teams can actually run and maintain.

I am strongest at the intersection of:

- **Security engineering**
- **Automation**
- **Cloud / containerized delivery**
- **Data integration and correlation**
- **Operational reliability**
- **AI-assisted security tooling (with governance and auditability)**

---

## How I Work

### 1) I turn ambiguity into systems
I am comfortable starting from unclear requirements, messy environments, or inconsistent data. My default approach is to:

1. Clarify the operational problem
2. Define what “working” means in practice
3. Build a solution that can be used and maintained by a team
4. Document and standardize it so it scales

### 2) I build for operators, not demos
I care about whether a solution is:

- usable by other engineers
- stable in production
- maintainable after handoff
- measurable in impact

I naturally think in terms of:

- runbooks
- repeatability
- guardrails
- operational reliability
- reduced manual effort

### 3) I prioritize outcomes over novelty
I like practical engineering. I am not chasing complexity for its own sake. I prefer systems that are:

- simple enough to operate
- secure by design
- resilient under real constraints
- useful to the teams who depend on them

### 4) I communicate across technical and non-technical groups
I can work across engineering, security, IAM, endpoint, and infrastructure teams. I translate requirements into deployable controls and communicate architecture decisions clearly.

### 5) I take ownership end-to-end
I am comfortable owning work across the full lifecycle:

- design
- build
- deployment
- documentation
- production support
- iterative improvement

## What Excites Me

### Problem types that energize me

- **Messy operational problems** with real constraints
- **Security automation** that materially reduces manual work
- **Data reconciliation and correlation** across systems that don’t agree
- **Production-grade internal tooling** that improves visibility and response
- **Cloud and containerized services** with clear operational impact
- **AI-assisted security workflows** when they are auditable and safe to operate

### Signals I’m in the right environment

I am most engaged when a team values:

- shipping and reliability
- documentation and maintainability
- security + developer velocity (not one at the expense of the other)
- measurable outcomes
- ownership and execution

### What I find meaningful

I like building systems that:

- make security teams faster
- reduce ambiguity during remediation
- improve data quality and trust
- create durable workflows others can run without me
- hold up under real-world operational demands

---

## How I Contribute

### Core contribution pattern

I consistently contribute by:

- building automation that removes repetitive work
- improving visibility across fragmented systems
- reconciling inconsistent records into actionable data
- accelerating remediation workflows
- creating guardrails and documentation so delivery scales
- shipping tools that stay useful after launch

### What I bring to a team

#### Security Engineering
- I build and operate production security systems, not just prototypes.
- I focus on deployable controls and measurable risk reduction.
- I think in terms of remediation, reliability, and operational fit.

#### Automation and DevSecOps
- I automate high-friction workflows with Python and PowerShell.
- I build CI/CD-oriented workflows and operational tooling.
- I care about repeatability, maintainability, and handoff quality.

#### Cloud / Platform
- I can deliver containerized services and internal tools in cloud environments.
- I work well at the intersection of infrastructure, security, and application engineering.
- I design with operational realities in mind (deployment, secrets, access, support).

#### Security Data and Analytics
- I am good at integrating multiple data sources and reconciling drift/inconsistency.
- I build pipelines and tooling that improve visibility and decision quality.
- I value metrics and actionable reporting over noisy dashboards.

#### AI for Security (Applied, not hype)
- I use AI where it improves workflow quality and speed.
- I care about auditability, safety, and responsible deployment.
- I treat AI systems as operational tools that need governance.

## What Makes Me Different

### 1) I bridge security and software engineering
I am not only a security practitioner and not only a software engineer. I build systems that make security work operationally effective.

### 2) I care about the “after”
A lot of people can build a tool. I focus on what happens after delivery:

- Can a team run it?
- Is it documented?
- Is it safe?
- Is it observable?
- Does it reduce effort in practice?

### 3) I combine pragmatism with technical depth
I can work across:

- endpoint operations
- cloud deployments
- full-stack internal tooling
- data pipelines and correlation
- AI-assisted workflows

That range helps me solve problems that span organizational boundaries.

## Work Values

### I value
- Clear ownership
- Practical outcomes
- Documentation and maintainability
- Engineering rigor
- Security as an enabler (not just a blocker)
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Reliability in production

### I avoid / dislike
- Purely performative “innovation” without operational value
- Tools with no maintenance plan
- Security controls that don’t match real workflows
- Ambiguity that nobody owns
- Fragile systems handed off without documentation

---

## Preferred Role Fit

### Best-fit environments
- Teams building internal platforms or security tooling
- Organizations with real operational complexity
- Roles where security, reliability, and developer workflows intersect
- Engineering cultures that care about documentation and production quality
- Companies that want builders, not just ticket processors

### Best-fit responsibilities
- Security automation engineering
- DevSecOps / platform security engineering
- Cloud security engineering
- Internal security tools and services
- Security data engineering / correlation tooling
- AI-assisted security workflow tooling (with governance)

## Cover Letter Guidance (LLM-oriented)

### Tone to use for me
- grounded
- direct
- technically credible
- pragmatic
- operationally focused
- confident but not inflated

### Themes to emphasize
- “I turn ambiguity into a plan and ship reliable systems.”
- “I build tooling and automation teams can actually run.”
- “I focus on operational outcomes, not just technical novelty.”
- “I document, standardize, and create guardrails.”
- “I work well across security, infrastructure, and engineering.”

### Themes to avoid overplaying
- Generic “passion for cybersecurity” language
- Abstract mission statements without technical relevance
- Buzzword-heavy AI claims
- Overstating leadership if the role is primarily IC-focused
- Purely academic or theoretical framing

### Strong phrasing patterns (aligned to me)
- “I do my best work where the problems are messy and the constraints are real.”
- “My strength is turning ambiguity into a clear plan, then shipping tooling teams can maintain.”
- “I focus on systems that improve visibility, reduce manual effort, and hold up in production.”
- “I build guardrails and documentation so what I deliver is usable beyond the initial release.”
- “I’m comfortable working across cloud, security tooling, and engineering workflows.”
